This is a set of class libraries that we have created in the course of developing BeOS applications. We find them fairly useful, and are releasing them as open source in the hope that others will as well. Click View for long list of features.

The main features these class libraries include are:

* The ArpLayout library (Yes, Yet Another Layout Library) for creating font-sensitive user interfaces.
* The ArpTerminal library, which provide classes for a complete terminal widget.
* A set of collection classes for using a templatized vector container in public interfaces.
* An architecture for exposing "configuration" interfaces of a set of objects, and automatically combining these into a standard BTabView-based layout.
* Helper classes for managing sets of add-ons and multiple search directories.
* The FFont class, my proposal for putting BFont objects into messages.

All of the documentation (and all header files) for this library is available from the Angry Red Planet web site, if you would like to peruse it before downloading the whole thing.

Note that the listed binary files for ArpCommon only contain a pre-compiled version of the ArpLayout example program. This are provides as a small example of ArpLayout's capabilities, for the less patient amoung us. You must compile the full ArpCommon source distribution to do any development with it.
